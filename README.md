# audio visual instruments, summer 2023
Here's a set of audio visual instruments I made using Jitter on Max/MSP in the summer of 2023. Some of them are audio-reactive, and they all have elements which can be manually altered with a MIDI controller. These are great for live performances where a projector or a screen monitor is involved. Feel free to use the files as you wish.

#5 is the last one I made, so it has some of my favorite features. The main content of the visual is audio-reactive. The Max patch is meant to open the audio file and video files contained within the folder it's located in. Although, your own audio files and video files can be used with the Max patch. Live stereo audio can also be passed to the Max patch (ex: use BlackHole to route audio from another program). This max patch is the most organized and ready to use; it is easy to use once you open the file within the folder.

#4 you are able to float a 3D text over a video or photo. The 3D text can rotate and move 3-dimensionally. The text also has the ability to change font & color and be stretched by x- and y-axis.

#3 plays a video that has simple playback and color control that can be overlayed in a vast amount of ways with an RGB split version of a video (ex: the reds can be highlighted for dark tones and blue for lighter tones). An audio wave also appears floating above the video blend, which shows whichever audio file's live waveform. The waveform can be changed in color and can appear either as dots, lines or filled-in area.

#2 activates the camera and can blend the camera footage with an "aura" version of the video, where an algorithm detects colors and shapes in the video and creates color blobs accordingly.

#1 activates the camera and has simple color changes that can be made to the video. There is also static colorful noise playing in the background of the camera footage.
